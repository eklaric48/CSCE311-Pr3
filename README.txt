PREREQUISITES:
The programs in this project should be run on one of the lab machines in the
Linux labs in Swearingen Engineerinng Center.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
There are two programs that can be run with the included files. These programs
demonstrate the implementation normal file I/O and memory mapped I/O.
To build the normal file I/O simply type:
    make standard
To run the program once built, type:
    ./standard <text_file_name>
Here, the <text_file_name> is the name of the text file that you wish to get
the character counts from.
To build the memory mapped file I/O simply type:
    make memorymap
To run the program once build, type:
    ./memorymap <text_file_name>
Here, the <text_file_name> is the name of the text file that you wish to get
the character counts from.

***Note, the text file name either needs to be an absolute path to the file name
or it needs to be the name of a text file located in the same directory as the
executable.

NOTICE
The reponses to the report questions are in the .pdf file within the submission
folder.
